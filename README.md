# hello-world
My very first program as a rookie programmer on gitHub
I'm a newbie rookie who just got into gitHub. Glad i found this community to give me a hand with my trending current school project oh and by the way just turned 18 a month ago guess i'm not a grown up still. finding it fun to sit on the computer for hours carving some code on the ground. still a new one though. Pleased to have you guys on board. Lastly comes in the reason i made some changes to my Bio which is because of turning 18 years old last month
